This is my text file for comp 141 extra credit!
I am filling it with the first ten lines of "Blackbird" by the Beatles.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
